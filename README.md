# Project 5
## Implementation / Features you added

I started this project weeks ago. I just happened to be working on a 3D maze game so rather than created a new one I took the opportunity expand upon this game and create a working build of the game. I made the music myself using Soundtrap and it actually didn't take long and I am proud of the way the sound mathces the feel of the game. I added a really cool looking start and end menu with functional buttons. I also added a pause menu which is pretty simple. This weekend I also added the spawners and enemies and the security clearence chips. I hope you don't mind that I expanded upon a game I had already started. I had a great time with this project and learned a lot.
